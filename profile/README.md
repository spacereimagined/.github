## About Space

Space takes the “self” out of self-storage, allowing you to store, ship, and receive your belongings anywhere, anytime.

- **Order Boxes** - Boxes come pre-labeled with tape, vacuum sealed bag + wrapping paper.  Boxes arrive in 3-days or less.
- **Pack Things** - Create box profiles in your Space account to never forget what’s in storage.  Add pictures, tags and descriptions.
- **Schedule Pick-Up** - Never visit a storage unit again.  Schedule a UPS pick-up and let them do all the heavy lifting.
- **Request Return** - Simply pick the box you want shipped back, chose any US address and have it delivered to you in 3-days or less.

With UPS as our global shipping and storage partner, your possessions will be available to you whenever you need them, throughout the US. And with the UPS network of warehouses, your boxes are delivered in 3-days or less.
